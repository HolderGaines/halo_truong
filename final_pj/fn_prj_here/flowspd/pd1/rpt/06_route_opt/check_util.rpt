**WARN: (IMPFP-7238):	CORE's corner: (348.0000000000 , 348.0000000000) is NOT on PlacementGrid,  Please use command getFPlanMode to check current Grid settings, use command setFPlanMode to change which grid to snap to. And use command get_snap_grid_info to get grids' offset and pitch. Command floorplan can be used to fix this issue.

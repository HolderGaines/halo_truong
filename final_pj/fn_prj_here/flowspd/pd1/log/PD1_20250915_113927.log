  The following route types were modified by the autotrimmer:
    clk_leaf (Metal1-Metal4) was replaced by clk_leaf_ccopt_autotrimmed (Metal2-Metal4);
      Layer Metal1 is trimmed off because its RC characteristic is not good
  To disable this behavior, either reduce the range of allowed layers or set the property "route_type_autotrim" to false.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Capacitance Violations
--------------------------

Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.300pF below cell i_croc_soc/i_croc/manual_cts (a lib_cell sg13g2_buf_1) at (1144.800,1327.020), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net i_croc_soc/i_croc/FE_RN_5 which is user don't touch. Achieved capacitance of 0.338pF.

Max Slew Violations
-------------------

Found 3 slew violations below cell i_croc_soc/i_croc/manual_cts (a lib_cell sg13g2_buf_1) at (1144.800,1327.020), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net i_croc_soc/i_croc/FE_RN_5 which is user don't touch with half corner delay_wc:setup.late. The worst violation was at the pin i_croc_soc/i_croc/gen_sram_bank_1__i_sram/gen_512x32xBx1_i_cut/A_CLK with a slew time target of 0.500ns. Achieved a slew time of 2.783ns.

=======================================================================
*info: Total 55 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     8 net(s): Could not be fixed because the gain is not enough.
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 7 net(s) were new nets created by previous iteration of DRV buffering. Further DRV fixing might remove some violations.

Extraction called for design 'croc_chip' of instances=52277 and nets=50925 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

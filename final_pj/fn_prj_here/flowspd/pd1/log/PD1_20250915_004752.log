Extraction called for design 'croc_chip' of instances=107735 and nets=51375 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 48 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 41 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     8 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

End to check current routing status for nets (mem=2819.3M)
Extraction called for design 'croc_chip' of instances=41810 and nets=40402 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

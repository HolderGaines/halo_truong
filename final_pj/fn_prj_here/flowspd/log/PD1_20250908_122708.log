	Capacitance filtering mode(-capFilterMode option of the setExtractRCMode) is 'relAndCoup' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'standard'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode is 'low'.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

*info: Total 46 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    13 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

*info: Total 46 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    13 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

*info: Total 46 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    13 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

**WARN: (IMPFP-3961):	The techSite 'sg13g2_ioSite' has no related standard cells in LEF/OA library. Cannot make calculations for this site type unless standard cell models of this type exist in the LEF/OA library. If the SITE is not used by the library you can ignore this warning or remove the SITE definition from the LEF/OA to avoid this message.
Type 'man IMPFP-3961' for more detail.
Adjust TopMetal1 preferred direction offset from 1.64 to 0.
Generated pitch 2.52 in TopMetal1 is different from 2.28 defined in technology file in preferred direction.
**WARN: (IMPFP-325):	Floorplan of the design is resized. All current floorplan objects are automatically derived based on specified new floorplan. This may change blocks, fixed standard cells, existing routes and blockages.

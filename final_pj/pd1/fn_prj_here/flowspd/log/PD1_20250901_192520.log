It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 47 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

Extraction called for design 'croc_chip' of instances=52025 and nets=50699 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

PreRoute RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

    Clock Tree Violations Report
    ============================
    
    The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
    A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
    Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
    
    
    Max Slew Violations

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 46 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    13 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

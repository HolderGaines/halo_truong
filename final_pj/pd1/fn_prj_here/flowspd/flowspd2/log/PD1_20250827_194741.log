**WARN: (IMPDC-1629):	The default delay limit was set to 101. This is less than the default of 1000 and may result in inaccurate delay calculation for nets with a fanout higher than the setting.  If needed, the default delay limit may be adjusted by running the command 'set delaycal_use_default_delay_limit'.

RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 39 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     7 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 46 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    14 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 46 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    14 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

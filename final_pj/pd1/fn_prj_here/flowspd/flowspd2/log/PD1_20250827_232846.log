MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 40 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:     7 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info: Total 1 net(s) were new nets created by previous iteration of DRV buffering. Further DRV fixing might remove some violations.

PreRoute RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.

*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

Extraction called for design 'croc_chip' of instances=47216 and nets=45815 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design croc_chip.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

*info: Total 47 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

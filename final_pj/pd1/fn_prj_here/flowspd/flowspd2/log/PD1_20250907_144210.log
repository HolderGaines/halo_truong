                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 47 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 47 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 47 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    15 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

**WARN: (IMPFP-7238):	CORE's corner: (348.0000000000 , 348.0000000000) is NOT on PlacementGrid,  Please use command getFPlanMode to check current Grid settings, use command setFPlanMode to change which grid to snap to. And use command get_snap_grid_info to get grids' offset and pitch. Command floorplan can be used to fix this issue.

**WARN: (IMPTR-2104):	Layer M6: Pitch=2280 is less than min width=1640 + min spacing=1640.
**WARN: (IMPTR-2108):	For layer M6, the gaps of 729 out of 729 tracks are narrower than 3.280um (space 1.640 + width 1.640).
Type 'man IMPTR-2108' for more detail.
 As a result, your trialRoute congestion could be incorrect.
